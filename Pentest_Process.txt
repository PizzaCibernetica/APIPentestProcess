Pentest Process

get API documentation
- could be public or private 
- user need documentation to figure out how to call API, what is the expected response body
- GET POST 
- usually ask client to provide a Postman collection: with this you can integrate wit hBUrp for a automated scan or for a manual scan


- DECIDE scope 
- how many GET
- PUT POST DELETE are iportant  
- check if version1 or 2 (v1 & v2)

- OWASP API top 10

- TOOLS 
    several automated tools 
    best is Burp
    Postman


TEST CASEs 

loook for abnormal HTTP headers (header base parameters : authentication is not in the cookie but in the header)

Authentication (each API need to do an authentication)

IDOR (indirect data object reference)

SSRF (server side request frgety) ()wwant to make sure server doesnt allor user tpo chaneg resouerces 

XML Attacks change content from JSON to XML -> if resposne eeroors -> try XML entity attack 

DoS  check if API has trhottling eneble -> how many times a user can make requestes
what if use Burp repeated and send thousnands request -> can lead to exhausting resoutces and effectively create a DoS

Injection Attacks = make sure try same injections on API , uninted commas 




BURP + Postman





Broken Object Level Authentication (BOLA)  (identical to IDOR Insecure direct object references (IDOR) - OWASP rename it to BOLA fro API )

    Legitimate = userId matches in tehquery parameter and request
    Attack = Attacker changes the userId in the query parameter 

    As a developer we dont want ot have sequential uer Id cause I can scroll and try for differnt userid just by adding a number 


Broken Authentication (most common)
